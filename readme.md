<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Berdron_Bot is a custom chat bot designed for Berdron's unique chatting needs. 

This bot contains a unique mix of practical tools and "because I can" tools. 

The core functionality of the this bot is to run a local service that twitch chat users can interact with me directly.

There are many features that allow for interaction in chat or on the stream overlay, but I wanted to extend the experience to the physical spaces as well. For this, I am creating a series of devices that will be connected and controlled by Berdron_Bot. 

One of the most amusing "because I can" features is how the Raspberry Pi will communicate with all these other devices. A NodeRed docker container will broadcast over a local MQTT network. This is completely unnecessary and therefor exactly what was needed.

To keep the bot beeping along and up to date, I will have a local MongoDB container running along side the bot which will be used to store all the info for the bot consume. There will also be a Redis cache container running that will query the MongoDB anytime there is a new chatter in chat. To ensure continuity, I will set up an off-raspi back-up for the MongoDB.


### ðŸ”§  Built With ðŸ”§

* [Node]()
* [Twitch API]()
* [MQTT]()
* [NodeRed]()
* [Docker]()
* [Arduino FastLED]() 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## ðŸš€ Usage ðŸš€

Most of the bot commands can be found via `!bbcommands` in twitch chat. I plan to migrate my usages of other bots to the berdron_bot entirely. 

Commands that are being implemented now:
* !bbcommands - send a link to the list of commands, here 
* !setcolor - set the color for yourself in chat
* !getcolor - get the color you have set
* !clearcolor - reset your color -> randomly selected for now
* !set_bot_color - a way to set the color for this Bot, redeemed by channel points
* !aboutbb - get info about the bot, link to here

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

This is the initial tech design I came up with. It will evolve and grow as the bot does.
